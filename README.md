# Movie System Project Using AI Algorithms

This project utilizes various AI algorithms to analyze and predict movie ratings and durations, offer genre-based movie search, and provide insights into IMDb's top 1000 movies dataset. The system employs techniques such as random forests and Naive Bayes classifiers, alongside search functionalities enhanced with fuzzy string matching.

## Features

- **Movie Rating Prediction**: Predict movie ratings using Random Forest based on movie duration and votes.
- **Movie Duration Prediction**: Estimate the duration of a movie directed by a specific director using Naive Bayes.
- **Search Movie by Title or Rating**: Implement fuzzy string matching to find movies by title or rate them.
- **Search Movie by Genre**: Advanced search functionality to filter movies by specific genres.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Automated scripts to clean and prepare data for analysis.
